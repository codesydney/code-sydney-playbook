# Managing version control / branches / pull requests

We use Github to manage our code as a team. Using Github's pull request functionality will ensure that we keep our codebase free of conflicts, while also maintaining a clean history of changes.

#### Starting with a Github Issue

- All tasks must start with a [Github Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
  - Go to Issues and click New Issue
  - Write down all the relevant details in the Issue
  - Link your team's project board by clicking "Projects" and selecting the relevant board
- Once you are starting work on the issue, go to your team's project board and move the Issue to In Progress

#### Writing your code

- Whenever you work on a new feature, do not develop on the `main` branch. By default, you will not be able to push into the `main` branch.
- Make sure your repo is up to date with the Github repo, with a `git pull`
- Create your own feature branch by navigating to the root of the directory and typing `git checkout -b "name-of-feature"`
  - Ideally you will just create one branch per feature or issue, to allow for easy merging and code review later on
  - If you are working on a branch that is tied to a Github Issue, then it's best to name the branch after the issue
- Work on your feature branch as normal and make sure to save all your files
- Once you are ready to push your code do `git add .` to stage your files for commit
- Commit your changes with a message of what you changed with `git commit -m "message you want to add"`
- Push your changes with `git push origin "name-of-branch"`. The terminal should return a Github link.
  - Click through to the Github link and you should now be on a Pull Request page.

#### Submitting a Pull Request

- Edit the details of your pull request and add your teammates as reviewers
  - You will find that your PR will be pre-loaded with a template
  - Make sure you reference the right issue # when prompted, as this will automatically link your PR with your issue
- Link the PR to your Github project board by going to "Projects" and selecting your project board
- Once the PR has been reviewed, the team leader will merge the change into the `main` branch and safely delete the branch from within Github
  - There might be a chance that you run into a merge conflict. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github) on how to deal with merge conflicts on Github.
- Remember to `git pull` into your `main` branch locally to keep everything up to date before working on your next feature
