# Setting up your machine

## Steps

- Setup Github. Full guide on [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
  - Github is where all of Code.Sydney's code is stored, and you will need to set up your computer to be able to push and pull code to and from your repository
- Download Slack on your computer and sign into the Code.Sydney Slack workspace. [Link here](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/downloads)
  - You can also access this directly from your web browser by going to [Code.Sydney's Slack](https://codesydney.slack.com/).
- Download an IDE / Code Editor. The most popular one today is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but there are other code editors out there that might be for you.
- Install your preferred web browser for development
  - Chrome is the most popular web browser so it's always a safe choice, but there are other alternatives. Check [this link](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2021/06/7-best-browsers-for-developers-in-2021/) for a rundown of some of them.
- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## FAQs

- What about your favourite technology?
  - Aside from hosting our code on Github, each project will have their own tech stack, so you may need to install additional tech to work on your project.
