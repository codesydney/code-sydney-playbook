# How is a project kicked off?

## Steps
- Engramar to create a Slack channel for the project and invite the team
- Assemble the team (see [./join-a-project.md](./join-a-project.md))
- Create a Github repo for the project and add the team members as collaborators
  - Setup Github repo so that it requires pull requests before merging into `main`
- Agree on what the project deliverable is and what the client expectations are
- Agree on your meeting schedule
  - Typically we will hold a 30-min weekly meeting at a time most convenient for the team
- Agree on your tech stack
  - While we will not dictate the tech stack you choose, it's important to agree on this as early as possible, as switching tech later on will introduce risks around delivery commitment and the project in general.
  - You should at least agree on the following: 
    - What front-end framework will we use? React? Vue? Angular? Vanilla JS? Others?
    - What back-end framework and database will we use? Express + MongoDB? Express + MySQL? Python Flask/Fast API?
    - How will the site be hosted? Code.Sydney has a Vercel account so it's likely we will use this 
- As a volunteer, be upfront with the following:
  - What is your current skill level and what do you want to work on? *There's always going to be work to do, so we will never judge you on your current skill level, but it's important to set the expectations upfront so the team will know how to effectively split up work*
  - How much time can you commit to the project? *Because this is a volunteer project, this is entirely up to you. Again, we won't force you to devote a certain number of hours, but it's important to set this expectation early with the team, and let the team know if your circumstances might change.*
