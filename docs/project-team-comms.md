# Communicating with your project team

## Details
We have the following communication methods within our project teams
- Slack
  - Slack is the primary method of day-to-day communication with your team 
  - It's best to use your project Slack channel over 1:1 communication, as having a discussion in a Slack channel allows other team members to observe and contribute to the discussion
  - Use Slack threads when appropriate to reduce clutter. See this [guide to threads](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organise-discussions-). 
- Github
  - If you want to have a more focused discussion on a specific feature or topic, you can communicate within Github issues or within the pull request
  - You can tag the relevant team members by going @username and they will get an email 
- Weekly meeting
  - Upon commencing the project, the project team will decide their weekly meeting schedule
  - Weekly meetings typically last no more than 30 minutes and are led by the Project Lead 
  - Content will be around what has been delivered, if the project is on or off track, and ultimately what we want to update to the client
