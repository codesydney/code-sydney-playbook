# Joining a Code.Sydney Project

Volunteering at Code.Sydney is a great way to gain real-world experience in a team setting, while contributing to a project supporting a non-profit organisation. 

## Steps
- A new volunteer project will be published on #general channel
  - The post will contain details about who the client is, what the deliverable is, and what the roles are
  - Roles are typically broken down into the following
    - Project lead: Leads the project and helps organise the different tasks for the developers to follow. 
    - Frontend developer: Deals with what is displayed on the browser. Typically works on HTML/CSS/Javascript and optionally a front-end framework like React, Angular, or Vue. Depending on the needs of the project, may also deal with fetching API information from the backend. 
    - Backend developer: Deals with how data is stored on the database and builds APIs to allow the frontend to interact with the data. 
- Express your interest by either replying to the post or directly messaging the publisher

## FAQs
- Who determines the roles?
  - Roles and team size are determined based on the size and complexity of the client's requirements
  - This is determined by the project team after meeting with the client
