# Code.Sydney's Project Playbook

## About this playbook

This is meant to be a collection of best practice tips to make your transition to project work at Code.Sydney as smooth as possible. 

This is NOT meant to micromanage you on the tech used to develop the project itself. Project teams are free to use their preferred tech and are free to implement the project however they like. For example, we won't mind if you choose to use Vue, Angular, React, or even vanilla javascript.

We'd love to get your feedback on this! To contribute to this repo, join the #playbook channel on Code.Sydney's Slack and let us know your thoughts.
